# Coding-1-Final
 
 The website I created is about the mountains. It has a slide show of different mountains and views. It has a footer that features the website link. I also made a hand drawn logo it is in the top left hand conner of every page. It features a snowy mountain landscape and a colorful sky, for my website. I have a contact page that you can go to get more information. All my colors are appealing and go nicely with the pictures without being overwhelming. On the about page a have a brief description about myself and what I like to do.
